# ðŸ”° PRIORITY QUEUE NOTES:

# 1. A priority queue is a special type of queue where elements are ordered based on priority.
# 2. Elements with higher priority are dequeued before elements with lower priority.
#    âž¤ Lower numerical value means higher priority (e.g., 1 is higher than 3)
# 3. Implemented using `heapq` in Python which provides a min-heap by default.
# 4. Basic operations:
#    - Enqueue: Use `heapq.heappush(queue, (priority, item))`
#    - Dequeue: Use `heapq.heappop(queue)` to get the item with the lowest priority number
#    - Peek: Access `queue[0]` to look at the item with the highest priority
# 5. Time complexity:
#    - Enqueue and Dequeue: O(log n)
#    - Peek: O(1)
