# Python program to add two numbers

a = 78      # First number
b = 99      # Second number
c = a + b   # Adding the numbers

print(c)    # Output: 177

#remainder when a num is divided by 2

print("Remiander when a is divided by 2 is: ", a%2)  # Output: 0
print("Remiander when b is divided by 2 is: ", b%2)  # Output: 0
